## Synopsis

Create and edit html image maps with a standalone React App connectable to any backend that provides image data.

A first example implementation will be for TYPO3 CMS

## Motivation

In our example integration for TYPO3 CMS this app allows editors to enhance any image with an html image map that is not stored globally for that image but locally for the given reference.

## Installation

Clone the repo, run 'npm install' and 'npm run build'.

While you are developing we provide a task 'npm run watch' which adds local sass, jsx and browsify support.

## API Reference

TODO what the the App expects of a backend API.
